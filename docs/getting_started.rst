Getting Started
===============

This plugin allows to run scripts in the 2 _CloudCompares_ 'modes': GUI & CommandLine.

GUI
---

In GUI, there are 3 actions:

*  The REPL (Read Print Eval Loop) which allows for quick testing of some actions.
    .. image:: ../images/repl-icon.png

*  The editor which allows to create,edit,save python script and most importantly run them.
    .. image:: ../images/python-editor-icon.png

*  The file runner, which shows a small dialog where you can select a file and run it 
   whithout having to have the editor openned.

Scripts
_______

The typical python script will need to import Python modules that provide access to
functions and data-structures of cloudcompare:

.. code:: Python

    # cccorelib contains definitions of tools, such as Cloud2Cloud distance,
    # sampling algorithm, etc
    import cccorelib

    # pycc contains definitions of data structures and other things,
    # the most important being getting the current running CC instance
    # to retreive point cloud/meshes
    import pycc

    # The CC object is the interface that will allow you to navigate
    # the tree of files currently loaded, the list of files selected, etc
    CC = pycc.GetInstance()


CC will be an object of type :class:`pycc.ccPythonInstance`.

Plugin
______

It is also possible to create scripts or module that register actions
that will then be launch-able from the Ui, a bit like regular C++ plugins do.

In the plugin settings, you can indicate a path where custom python plugin are
stored. When starting up, the indicated folder will be scanned and all python modules
(.py files or folders) will be imported, which will allow them to register their actions
using the :func:`pycc.RegisterAction` function.


In the case of a simple ``.py`` module file, it would like like this.

.. code:: Python

    # hello_world_plugin.py
    import pycc

    pycc.RegisterAction(name="Hello World", target=hello_word_action)

    def hello_world_action():
        print("Hello from a python plugin")


You can also create a `class` plugin by creating a class that implements
the :class:`pycc.PythonPluginInterface`.
See `this <https://github.com/tmontaigu/CloudCompare-PythonPlugin/tree/master/script_examples/plugin_examples>`_
for an example.




Command Line
------------

Similarly a commandline script will start with the following lines:

.. code:: Python

    import cccorelib
    import pycc

    CC = pycc.GetCmdLineInstance()

CC will be an object of type :class:`pycc.ccCommandLineInterface`.


To run in command line mode pass following option: `-PYTHON_SCRIPT`

.. code:: shell

    cloudcompare -PYTHON_SCRIPT my_script.py


The plugin will take all arguments that follows the script name and populate
python's sys.argv with them:

Example:

.. code:: shell

    /path/to/cloudcompare -PYTHON_SCRIPT my_script.py some_positional_arg --size 50

Python's sys.argv will be equal to:
['/path/to/cloudcompare', 'some_positional_arg', '--size', '50']
