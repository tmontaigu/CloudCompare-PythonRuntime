Building from sources
=====================

In the following sections we assume that you know
how to compile CloudCompare from source, otherwise refer
to the CloudCompare documentation on how to do.


To Compile this plugin you need to have Python installed.


Windows
-------

1. Clone this project into CloudCompare/plugins/private
2. Create a virtual environment via ``venv`` or ``conda``
   
   .. code-block::
        
       # Python's venv
       python -m venv .\pyccvenv 

       # Conda environment
       conda create -n pyccenv 

3. Activate the environment

   .. code-block::

       # Python's venv (PowerShell)
       .\pyccenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

       # Conda environment
       conda activate pyccenv

4. install dependencies
    
   .. code-block::

       pip install -r requirements-release.txt

5. Generate the cmake config

    To generate the cmake config you have 2 options:

    1. Start the cmake generation while still within the activated environment
    
    2. Add ``-DPTYHON_EXECUTABLE="somepath_to_python.exe"``
       Where ``somepath_to_python.exe`` is the absolute path to the python executable 
       of the pyccenv created earlier. 

       To get it, run: ``python -c "import sys;print(sys.executable)"`` (while in the activated env)

    In both cases the cmake option to add in order to build the plugin in ``-DPLUGIN_PYTHON=ON``
   

Linux
-----


1. Clone this project in CloudCompare/plugins/private
2. Install additional dependencies

    Ubuntu: ``libpython3-dev`` and ``pybind11-dev`` (only available since 20.04)

    Fedora: ``python3-devel`` and  ``pybind11-devel``


3. Run cmake with ``-DPLUGIN_PYTHON=ON``
4. Build
5. Install

--------------------------------


Running the tests
_________________

Tests works by running CloudCompare in command line mode.
To run them, you need pytest, and you need to provide to pytest the path the where CloudCompare is installed

.. code-block::
    
    # in CloudCompare/plugins/private/CloudCompare-PythonPlugin:

    pytest --cloudcompare_exe "C:\CMakeBuilds\CloudCompare\Release\install\CloudCompare\CloudCompare.exe" tests

Building the documentation
__________________________

Building the documentation also works by running CloudCompare in command line mode.
To build the documentation:

.. code-block::

    cd docs
    .\make-docs.ps1 "C:\CMakeBuilds\CloudCompare\Release\install\CloudCompare\CloudCompare.exe"

Which by default will build the docs in HTML in docs/_build. Open docs/_build/index.html to view it.
(The output dir can be changed using the `-OutputDir` option)
