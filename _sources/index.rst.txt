CloudCompare-PythonPlugin
=========================


.. caution::

    This plugin is in its very early stage, so a lot of things are missings
    and some things may not work.

    And some names, functions are subject to change.


This plugin allows to write Python scripts in CloudCompare,
by providing python bindings to the set of CloudCompare's
libraries (that you can use in C++ plugins) as well as embedding a python
interpreter to run scripts.
